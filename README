choir_sample.py 

This script uses ecasound to try and achieve the effect of many people hitting
a drum. 

It takes a sample, and performs the folowing operations multiple times:
-adds a randomized quantity of silence at the beginning
-makes a randomized gain attenuation

Finally it mixes all down to the outfile and normalizes.
